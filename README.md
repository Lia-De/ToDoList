# To Do List app
Created 2025-01-08 as part of Lexicon course, fullstack C# developer.

## Initial state
The app contains three data models in their own db table (SQLite) for Project, Task and Tag. 

## Updated functions
I can add individual new Projects, Tasks and Tags. 
Tasks must be associated with a project, and may have identical names between projects.
Tags must be uniquely named, can have many per project, and many per task.
Can update all three categories.
Projects can be edited to add one or more new tags. Can not yet add a task on the Project editing view.

Frontend styled responsively, mobile-first.
